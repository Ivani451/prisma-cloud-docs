*Description* 


Using HTTPS for the API Protocol can help to protect against potential security risks such as man-in-the-middle attacks, in which an attacker intercepts and modifies the communication between the API and its clients.
HTTPS uses encryption to secure the communication between the API and its clients, which can help to prevent unauthorized access or tampering with the data being transferred.
