*Description* 


By default, the RAM password policy does not prevent password reuse, so it is important to enable this feature to help protect your account.
When password reuse is prevented, users will not be able to use a password that they have previously used for the account.
This can help to reduce the risk of unauthorized access, as it makes it more difficult for an attacker to guess or recover an old password.
