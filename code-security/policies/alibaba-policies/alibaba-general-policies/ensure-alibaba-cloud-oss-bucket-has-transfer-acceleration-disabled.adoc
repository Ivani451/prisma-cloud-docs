*Description* 


Transfer Acceleration is a feature in Alibaba Cloud OSS (Object Storage Service) that allows you to transfer large files over the internet more quickly by using optimized network paths.
While Transfer Acceleration can be useful for improving the speed of file transfers, it can also increase the cost of data transfer.
If you do not need the faster transfer speeds provided by Transfer Acceleration, or if you are trying to minimize costs, you may want to ensure that Transfer Acceleration is disabled for your OSS bucket.
Disabling Transfer Acceleration can help to reduce the cost of data transfer, as you will only be charged for standard data transfer rates rather than the higher rates associated with Transfer Acceleration.
