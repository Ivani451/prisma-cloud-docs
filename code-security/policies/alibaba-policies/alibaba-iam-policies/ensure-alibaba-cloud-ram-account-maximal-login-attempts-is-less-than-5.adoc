*Description* 


By default, the maximal login attempts for a RAM account is set to 5. After 5 failed login attempts, the account is locked. By lowering the number of allowed filed attempt, the risk of unauthorized access to the account is reduced, as the chances of guessing the correct login credentials are reduced.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 

To reduce the maximum amount of login attempts, add add the following code to your Terraform file during buildtime.
