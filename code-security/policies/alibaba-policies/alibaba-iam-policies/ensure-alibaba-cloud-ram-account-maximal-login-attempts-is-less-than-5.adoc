*Description* 


By default, the maximal login attempts for a RAM account is set to 5.
This means that an unauthorized user can make up to 5 failed login attempts before the account is locked.
If the maximal login attempts is set to a lower value, such as 3 or 2, it will take fewer failed login attempts to lock the account.
This can help to reduce the risk of unauthorized access to the account, as it makes it more difficult for an attacker to guess the correct login credentials.
