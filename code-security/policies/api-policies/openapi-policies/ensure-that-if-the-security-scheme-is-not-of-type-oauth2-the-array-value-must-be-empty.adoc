*OpenAPI* 


Ensure that your generated OpenAPI document does not include a security section for authentication types that are not OAuth 2.0.
Below is an example:
[,yaml]
----
securityDefinitions:
some_auth:
type: basic
- security:
-  - some_auth:
-      - write: some
-      - read: some
